# bmi_vs_sugar_consumption
Project for Udacity Data Analysis nanodegree to wrangle, clean, combine and compare 3 Gapminder datasets and analyze and report the results. 

    I've used a combination of Gapminder datasets and  merged them together to do the analysis.

    The raw datasets are as follows:

    *  body mass index women
    *  body mass index men
    *  sugar consumption per persion per day
    *  life expectancy in years


    I wanted to see if there was any connection between any of these datasets. My thinking is that high sugar 
    consumption could lead to higher BMI, and both could potentially lead to shorter life expectancy.

## Installation

  This project consists of a jupyter notebook, 4 data files, and an html report with findings.

    * BMI - Sugar consumption Dataset.ipynb
    * sugar_per_person_g_per_day.csv
    * body_mass_index_bmi_women_kgperm2.csv
    * body_mass_index_bmi_men_kgperm2.csv
    * life_expectancy_years.csv
    * BMI - Sugar consumption Dataset.html


Download the files to a directory

## Usage

    * Run the wrangle_act.ipynb from within jupyter. 
    * The report (BMI - Sugar consumption Dataset.html) can be viewed from a browser to see the results without having to run the notebook.
